<p4>Haruka is a calm, collected, and polite girl that's not afraid to show her smile. She remains strong and tough during battles and sweet and kind in school. She refers to herself as "Narumi", meaning she puts her last name first, which is a sign of her maturity. She aspires to become a doctor when she is is older.

Despite her kind and gentle disposition, she has an interest in violent, action-packed shounen manga. </p4>
